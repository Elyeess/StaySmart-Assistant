had everything we needed and more maps suggestions movies etc would recommend his apartment to anyone and would definitely stay there again on my next trip to paris  riccardos flat is in an excellent location in paris and is ideally located near the 1 and 7 lines for the metro as they are within 100 meters riccardo himself is also an extremely helpful host as we were able to converse before the start of our stay at the apartment to make sure i had all of the necessary information \\r \\r all of the living spaces are well kept and it is very nice to have the washer when on a longer holiday  furthermore the internet is extremely fast all around and excellent location to explore paris as it is located at the heart of the city within site of the louvre at the end of the street and within a short walk of the notre dame st germain des pres and many other sites that you will surely want to visit great value for your money  thanks again riccardo i was very lucky that riccardo allowed me and my family to stay at his place he is super kind and has wonderful taste the flat was comfortable even for 3 adults and made us really feel like home with its reasonable price we shopped from the supermarket nearby and cooked plenty delicious meals from riccardos handy kitchen \\r the neighborhood is peaceful and safe it is paris everyone dreams of i would definitely like to stay at this place again and again    riccardos flat is a beautiful comfortable clean and convenient home base in the heart of paris it features a stunning view of a cathedral whose gargoyles are mere meters across a narrow alley from the flats three wide openable 4th floor windows lean out those windows a bit and look to your left and theres the louvre right across the street also a short walk south are the seine the pont neuf and notre dame walk in any other direction and quickly find innumerable cafes and restaurants tucked into gorgeously designed streets alleys and avenues \\r \\r riccardo was a gracious host providing us with a map to local grocery stores which we used buying bread cheese wine and water each day to take back to the flat and just generally being very kind and helpful the bathroom has a toilet sink and shower that all work perfectly and the kitchen has a stove that we happily used to brew coffee every morning the wifi is so fast we were able to upload over a hundred photos every night with ease we look forward to staying here on our next visit we had a great stay in this wonderfully located very clean flat the host was absolutely nice and very helpful tasteful retrostyle with big confortable bed with direct view of the rooftop of the gothic church as well  if needed  of the big tv very private and quiet house no noises from the churchstreet etc at all 3min from metrostation or louvre\\r it is an old house though and the windows are badly isolated for cold witer nights and the heating is only moderate gets ok warm if you close the blinds all in all a very good place which we can honestly recommend stayed for 10 days for new year holidays location is the best view from the apartment amazing i love the interior  books everywhere wooden furniture an old piano along with the modern stuff like wifi fully equipped kitchen cable tv the host riccardo is very easy to communicate i did not have a chance to meet him as he was on holiday himself but he left

thoroughly explained all the features of the loft he even volunteered information to help us navigate the subway upon our departure which was aboveandbeyond even though english is not his first language he coped very well with our language and certainly made us feel welcome\\r \\r the only downsides to richards loft are mentioned in the description it is a fourthfloor walkup so those with excessively heavy luggage or an aversion to stairs should be cautious also the bells of church across the street are quite loud although they were pretty and did not disrupt our sleep\\r \\r in all a very positive experience and i would certainly recommend richard as a host to anyone looking for a place to stay in central paris at a much more affordable price than most similarlylocated hotels

wife he has been very helpful to us the place is spacious and the location is also very good we are really happy that we choose his place id highly recommend his place to those who are looking for a place to stay in paris we could not enjoy catherines apartment only one night we met catherine during our installation she provided us with all the information necessary for our installation and our stay the appearance is well appointed quiet the comfortable beds very well located in relation to the metro we will try to come back richard is extremely friendly and did more than everything to accommodate us  the location of the flat was perfect  it is between the louvre museum and the notre dame cathedral right in the middle of great shops and cafes this is a perfect place for a singlecouple traveler with its warm and cozy atmosphere and parisian mood you can probably enjoy true parisian lifestyle  i particularly loved the view from the window which shows really old church a bit creepy at midnight though it was a perfect desk to read some old books from which i could occasionally glimpse the medieval architecture  the best part of the flat is its location it is placed just across louvre museum which makes it incredibly close to almost every attractions of the city its only few steps from the metro station louvrerivoli though id mostly enjoyed walking the host richard was very kind and helpful the location of this apartment is amazing  it was the perfect spot for our family of four clean comfortable and full of character  we highly recommend we had an amazing stay at richards place the location is awesome and his home was perfect for us the apartment is very quiet and pleasant combined with practical equipment such as drying washing machinethe district is quite central and accessible from most stations and metro linesthe building is quiet and located in a busy streethowever we noticed in catherine that the dishes was not very clean when we arrived and we encountered some technical problems in terms of tv and the phone that unfortunately tainted our stay my family greatly enjoyed staying at richards apartment he was very flexible with the checkin and even allowed us to come earlier on a moments notice as our plans had changed  it was great to meet him and get to know him a little bit and he was thorough in showing us the ins and outs of his apartment he welcomed us with wine and camenbart and even gave my daughter a copy of petit prince  the view of the gothic church is spectacular and how nice to learn about a  historic  church you might otherwise miss with among the sites of louvre and notre dame the apartment is in the center of it all and many sites are walkable we also used the transit app to  get directions and take buses to restaurants and markets a  bit further a field and to the eiffel tower so easy to get around and nice to mingle with locals and see street life our stay at richards place was fantastic the location is perfect just opposite the louvre and nearby to notre dame the atmosphere and persian feel of the accommodation added to a wonderful stay i can highly recommend richards abode wendy and perry that view is incredible we had a great time staying at richards flat the location is unbeatable the seine is around the corner and the louvre is across the street its within walking distance to many top attractions in paris the view of the cathedral from the window is amazing the room is small but cozy and perfect for two of us and richard is a great host and is very easy to communicate with he is also super kind and allows us to check out late as our train is in late afternoon and we can leave our luggages in the flat while we go visit louvre id highly recommend this place to anyone who wishes to visit paris the location of this apartment was great walking distance to the louvre notre dame and sainte chapelle  when renting consider there are 4 floors without a lift be sure you will be able to carry your luggage up  we heard some negative news about paris before we went there but when we were really there we found that the people there were so friendly polite and cooperative and the public security was very good  we didnt meet any problem  and the owner of the flat richard is a very nice person very thoughtful helpful and friendly  i like his welcome flowers and wine he wrote to me before we arrived telling me how to reach his flat and pick up keys and he was very patient answering my various kinds of questions  and it was a great experience living in his apartment everything was so convenient to louvre to metro station to restaurants and to the super market  everything is within 200 metres or 5 minutes we will for sure to select this flat again when we come to paris next time   great location  perfect host  fast cooperative makes life easy  wonderful place and perfect location richard was a good host and is very willing to make the stay comfortable recommendation we had a wonderful 5 days at richards flat location is simply outstanding unbelievably its almost on top of the louvre but very quiet one minute walk from louvrerivoli metro and ten from the rer so easy if coming from the eurostar or cdg so much to see nearby all walking distance and fun to just wander cafes shops restaurants in abundance coming with recommendations from richard the flat is charming with plenty of space to spread out bed extremely comfortable kitchen basic but everything you need bathroom same three very large windows for fresh air and wooden shutters for sleeping richard very hospitable and accommodating he helped me up the stairs with my luggage definitely would stay again when in paris great place for those who want close location to many sites the beds were very comfortable fresh and warm the kitchen was a little tight but had everything you would need the stairs were not too bad but the view was worth it we felt very comfortable staying at richards place and would be happy to stay there again great location great recommendations from host on drinking and eating spots very comfortable flat since i was a child in my early teens ive dreamt of going to france the large eiffel tower poster on my wall that i would sit and get lost in building an image in my mind of what it would look like smell like sound like feel like  i finally took advantage of a change to go 2 weeks and bring my 11 year old daughter  firstly in the south of france followed by 4 nights at richards flat in paris  in part due to richards flat decor location cleanliness his incredible communication despite some hiccups caused on my part paris exceeded my expectant dreams  i cannot speak highly enough of richard and the hospitality of his flat with its gorgeous views and proximity to the louvre and during the presidential election of macron was an experience we will never forget  while the flat was smaller than anticipated it sufficed in every necessity we could want or need and even has prompted me to downsize upon our return to the states  what an experience that any trip we take in the future will have to meet least of all attempt to exceed  merci boucoup richard  we now love france 3 we thoroughly enjoyed staying in richards apartment it was clean comfortable  very parisian richard welcomed us with a bottle of wine  lots of information about paris maps etc location was perfect very close to the louvre shops cafes  public transport it was all very easy richard was very responsive to messages via airbnb app highly reccomend staying here we had a wonderful stay in paris richard met us at the apartment and could not have been more helpful he is a good host and we had good response when any questions that came up location of the apartment made walking to many sights very convenient over all a very enjoyable stay while we did not have the pleasure to meet richard he was in communication routinely and responded quickly  the loft is il a central location and is charming and reflects the parisian experience including its history that we were looking for    richard is an extremely gracious and welcoming host his place is very clean secure and in an amazing location we highly recommend richard and is place my family wife 8yo and 10yo stayed at richards place for 5 nights  the size of the flat was just right for our group and far more comfortable than a hotel  richard met us upon arrival and we explained everything about the apartment and made recommendations for shopping restaurants etc  he is super interesting man and we enjoyed getting to know him the location is awesome  the church across the street is beautiful and the flat looks right out to the gargoyles which my kids loved  the louvre is about 200 meters away as is the seine  we were able to walk to many of the beautiful parisian sights notre dame saint chapelle musse dorsay musee pompidou luxembourg gardens place de la concorde and take uber for about 15 euro to some places that were a bit too far for the kids to walk eiffel tower and sacre coeur there are great paths along the river for running which are beautiful and full of people hanging out with friends finally having a washing machine in the flat was great so that we could pack a bit lighter and have clean clothes we visited other cities as well on the same trip great place super host  richards place has the best location in paris strategic situated just a short 35 min walk to the louvre the seine river about 1015 min scenic walk to musee dorsay and musee dorangerie the apartment is also within less than 5min walk to the metro and rer plenty of good restaurants and bakeries around and main shopping strip the apartment is clean and very charming in its layout check in was very easy richard met us on the street and meticulously oriented us to his home the apartment is located on european 4th floor american 5th floor and there is no elevator it is not a problem for us and we enjoy the daily light exercise but it may be worth knowing ahead of time overall we love richards place and will definitely stay here again if we return to paris our

Apartment = Amazing Excellent location to visit Paris, only 5 minutes from the Pantheon, Luxembourg gardens and 10 from Notre Dame.  Lots of places to eat and drink nearby.\\r<br/>The apartment is quiet, placed away from the road.  The one point to mention is the bed is up a ladder so not for all ages!\\r<br/>Great communication from C\\u00e9line from start to finish.\",\n          \"Our stay here was AMAZING!! The apartment looks the exact same as it does in the pictures and the location was perfect-- right next to the Louvre and SO close to many great neighborhoods! Three of us stayed at the apartment and there was plenty of space for everyone. Richard was a perfect host and was very accomodating-- had everything we needed and more (maps, suggestions, movies, etc). Would recommend his apartment to anyone and would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Paris!  Riccardo's flat is in an excellent location in Paris and is ideally located near the 1 and 7 lines for the metro as they are within 100 meters. Riccardo himself is also an extremely helpful host as we were able to converse before the start of our stay at the apartment to make sure I had all of the necessary information. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>All of the living spaces are well kept and it is very nice to have the washer when on a longer holiday.  Furthermore, the Internet is extremely fast. All around and excellent location to explore Paris as it is located at the heart of the city within site of the Louvre at the end of the street and within a short walk of the Notre Dame, St. Germain des Pres and many other sites that you will surely want to visit. Great value for your money!  Thanks again Riccardo! I was very lucky that Riccardo allowed me and my family to stay at his place. He is super kind and has wonderful taste. The flat was comfortable even for 3 adults and made us really feel like home with its reasonable price. We shopped from the supermarket nearby and cooked plenty delicious meals from Riccardo's handy kitchen. \\r<br/>The neighborhood is peaceful and safe, it is Paris everyone dreams of. I would definitely like to stay at this place again and again.    Riccardo's flat is a beautiful, comfortable, clean and convenient home base in the heart of Paris. It features a stunning view of a cathedral whose gargoyles are mere meters across a narrow alley from the flat's three wide, openable 4th floor windows. Lean out those windows a bit and look to your left and there's the Louvre right across the street. Also a short walk south are the Seine, the Pont Neuf, and Notre Dame. Walk in any other direction and quickly find innumerable cafes and restaurants tucked into gorgeously designed streets, alleys and avenues. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Riccardo was a gracious host, providing us with a map to local grocery stores (which we used, buying bread, cheese, wine and water each day to take back to the flat) and just generally being very kind and helpful. The bathroom has a toilet, sink and shower that all work perfectly, and the kitchen has a stove that we happily used to brew coffee every morning. The wifi is so fast, we were able to upload over a hundred photos every night with ease. We look forward to staying here on our next visit. We had a great stay in this wonderfully located, very clean flat. The host was absolutely nice and very helpful. Tasteful retro-style with big confortable bed with direct view of the rooftop of the gothic church, as well - if needed - of the big TV! Very private and quiet house. No noises from the church/street etc at all. 3min from Metro-Station or Louvre!\\r<br/>It is an old house, though, and the windows are badly isolated for cold witer nights, and the heating is only moderate. Gets ok warm if you close the blinds. All in all a very good place which we can honestly recommend. Stayed for 10 days for New Year holidays. Location is the best, view from the apartment amazing, I love the interior - books everywhere, wooden furniture, an old piano along with the modern stuff like wifi, fully equipped kitchen, cable TV. The host Riccardo is very easy to communicate, i did not have a chance to meet him as he was on holiday himself, but he left he keys with the neighbors, explained all the details, left five guide books. Really recommend this truly Parisian apartment Excellent place right in the heart of Paris! This is a wonderful apartment in a perfect location for all of the sites in Paris.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this location.  Richard helped make our Parisien experience the very best. Our stay in Richard's flat was wonderful. Richard is indeed a kind and thoughtful host. There is not much to add to previous reviews of this place - it is simply ideal if you want to stay in central Paris. Thank you Richard for sharing your flat and beautiful belongings with us. We had such a wonderful time staying in Richard's place. The location of this apartment truly is ideal, you are so close to the Louvre and easy walking distance from many other sites. The apartment itself feels so Parisian and cosy, with a truly breathtaking view. On Sunday morning we heard the church bells at around 9AM - a very fun memory to have. Richard himself was very welcoming, a great host. We'll definitely stay here again when we go back to Paris! We had a wonderful stay at Richard's place. It is very convenient, just 2 minutes from the metro station and Louvre Museum. The river Seine is just around the block for wonderful walks. Great restaurants and cafes are a stones throw away as well. We highly recommend Richards place.   Richard was a great host. He was always easy to reach. Unfortunately we didn't get the chance to meet him but he was kind enough to have a friend let us in and show us the ropes. The views were stunning and location was absolutely fabulous. Ideally located !!!In a neighborhood with a lot of options to eat or drink.It has a good illumination and is equipped with everything you need.Good communication and good coordination.I really recommend it! Richard's apartment in Paris was just what we were looking for.   You can actually see the Louvre from the apartment. It has great light and a beautiful view of the cathedral across the way. It's not huge, but it has a great layout and an open feel.  <br/>The street it is on is quiet and we ended up not needed the metro at all. We could just rent bikes around the corner and bike everywhere.  Thank you so much! It was fantastic! very nice house in a really quiet place, although that it is the center of Paris, incredible location, the apartment gorgeously furnished with antique furniture, very nice graphics and paintings on the walls. It was one of the best apartments for all of our travels around the world! Richard lovely friendly welcoming host, he spent much of his time helping us when we had problems with taking velib. Thank you, Richard! Sorry for my terrible English! I will recommend this apartment to all my friends! The flat is very well equipped, everything is handy and in particular, the wireless connection is excellent. We had a wonderful time in our week's stay in Paris. We happened to come in the midst of an extremely rare snow storm with flight delays. Richard went out of this way to accommodate us the day after scheduled arrival and showed us the ropes. It's a great place and the location can't be beat. We were lucky to find such a wonderful place to spend our time in what felt like a more Parisian experience than staying at a hotel. We'll be back! Amazing truly is the word for Riccardo's beautiful flat in central Paris.  Not only is the flat extremely conveniently located (literally next door to the Louvre and minutes walking distance from Notre Dame and St. Germain-des-pres), but also the flat itself has so much character.  You truly feel like you are spending the weekend in your own flat in central Paris.  The location of the flat was excellant. I highly recommend Richard's flat. Very nice view and walking distance to every where. Riccardo's place is fantastic. It has everything you will need. Most importantly the location is the best you could hope for. I bought a Metro pass and hardly used it! You can see the Louvre from the flat and the Siene is around the corner. The WEst Bank is just minutes away. The location of Richard's apartment cannot be beaten. Literally steps from the Louvre and just across the Pont Neuf from St Germaine. The apartment itself is very roomy and comfortable - with those amazing views. Highly recomended. My cousin and I stayed at Richards charming apartment for three nights during our time in Paris .  We couldn't have picked a better place to stay.  Richard was a wonderful host.  He provided us with maps, tips and recommendations for restaurants in the area.  His apartment was clean, comfortable and equipped with anything we could possibly need. Location was prime. Close to metro. Easy commute to/from airport.  Richard greeted us at the flat and was friendly, thoughtful and accommodating.  The loft is in such a great location, so close to shops and the Louvre and the outlook of the gothic church from the loft is pretty amazing.  It is interesting inside with its many books and magazines so it has a welcoming lived in feel.\\r<br/>We are a grown up family of 4 and so Richard kindly accommodated us all with 3 double beds.  The flat was clean and had everything we needed (including wifi) and we would happily recommend it to others.  It would be especially perfect for a couple or two singles as it is all in one room and it would leave the couch free for sitting on.\\r<br/>Just be aware, as is clearly defined in the advertisement, there are 4 flights of stairs to climb.  Keeps you fit and makes up for the wonderful food to be had at your doorstep!\\r<br/> Excellent central location half a block from the Pont Neuf metro station and on a quiet side street a block from the Seine and a block from the Louvre, very comfortably furnished large studio apartment, perfect for two people, three large windows facing east with views of one of the oldest Gothic churches in Paris-- I highly recommend this apartment! Richard had such a beautiful flat in an incredible location! You can see the louvre from the window. Very close to the metro and all of the major Paris tourist spots. Richard was a great host and left us some information resources. We loved our stay in Paris! Amazing place indeed !\\r<br/>Me and my daughter spent 5 days in Paris.The apartment has a great view ,good taste , is near the Louvre, shopping centers, the bridges to the other side of the Seine, in a word-perfect.\\r<br/>The owner,Richard, is nice and friendly, helpful and communicative. The apartment itself is very pleasant, clean and well facilitated (wi-fi, kitchen, bath)  - felt \\\"at home\\\" .Highly recommended.\\r<br/>Victor\\r<br/>\\r<br/>  My husband and I recently stayed at Richard's flat and had a wonderful experience. Richard was a kind a gracious host. The flat appears as it does in the pictures and it was clean and very quiet. The space is comfortable and served as an ideal home base for our trip to Paris. It is centrally located and easily accessible by train as well. I highly recommend Richard's flat and would stay again. Great location, very clean and comfortable appartment, everything what you can need is in place!  Interesting view from the window:) Fully equipied. We came very late but we had no no problems with reaching the place and taking the keys!! Richard, thank you very much - my birthday passed very good also due to our perfect accomodation!\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Regards, \\r<br/>Galina I highly recommend Richard and his cozy little flat!  I was there for a week and, while I did not get to meet Richard in person, he was very good at communicating with me and making sure that everything was ok.  He also went above and beyond to help me when I was arriving earlier than normal check in time by making sure that I got the keys and instructions for the apartment.  He left guide books to help me and was just an excellent host.  The flat could not be better located for seeing the major sites in Paris, some of which are so close you basically just have to walk to the end of the street!  The apartment was clean and cozy and had excellent wifi as well.  This would be a wonderful place to stay for any single person or couple, especially a first time visitor to Paris.  Merci Beaucoup Richard! I really enjoyed staying here. Richard was a good host for us and gave us a good rate for the location and amenities of the flat. Perhaps would have been nice to have some hangers and a holder for the showerhead, but those are the only issues. Location, price, comfort were all great. the books throughout the flat really gave it a great atmosphere. Thanks so much! Richard is a charming, helpful and accomodating host.  This was my first Airbnb experience and it went very smoothly, thanks to Richard.  My wife and I both enjoyed our trip to Paris and Richard's apartment is well positioned, well equiped and convenient for many of Paris' attractions.  Our thanks to Richard for excellent communication, help and preparation in advance of our arrival and a smooth check out. we have a  good time in Richard's apartment . Richard is a very charming gentleman, as the apartment is ,the decoration is artistic,the paintings  ,the books and the ancient piano is attractive.Richard's apartment is well positioned,very convenient,situated between the Louvre and Pont Neuf,2 minutes walk can arrive the Louve and the river Seine.the appartment is well-found, here is like our home in paris, very warm ,it's a good memory .thank you, Richard  Richard was a gracious and very helpful host. The apartment's location was as described, with an amazing view and excellent internet. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Paris. Richard was a fantastic host. He met us at the door and explained everything, and even made us a much needed coffee before he jetted off. The apartment was in a PERFECT location -- you can't get more central than this -- and even though we weren't in it much, it had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable, the shower was hot and the windows looking out on the church were beautiful. Highly recommended -- we'll definitely be back! When Richard saw us coming up the stairs he quickly ran to meet us and helped with our bags. He showed us everything in the apartment and offered suggestions where to eat. The apartment was clean and charming. Richard gave very good directions.  The location was fantastic, a block from the Louvre, we could walk everywhere Richard is a great host! The place itself was perfect for us. The location was great and close to everything we wanted to see, and it was big enough for the 3 of us. Would definitely recommend!  Excellent location and accurately described. Would absolutely stay here again. Richard was very responsive and helpful. He provided many resources (maps, things to do, etc.) that were very useful. Thanks for a wonderful stay! Richard's place is wonderfully located close to the Louvre and a block or two from different metro lines. The view of the gothic church across the alley is very unique, and Richard's place has a very warm (and snug) charm to it. It feels like you're living in the flat of a university literature professor. (you probably are). Put the address into google maps directly, if you use the airbnb directions button it tries to send you someplace that doesn't exist. Richard was a great host. Very nice, super responsive and easy to communicate with. His place was conveniently located in the heart of Paris and was easy to get to anywhere in the city. Highly recommend.  Very good organization and good communication.Apartment as in description. Wonderful experience in Paris with great location. Richard is very considerate and helped us with the luggage. He always response to any of our questions very quick and the apartment was just great and we enjoyed being Parisian for 3 days. Will definitely recommend to friends who are visiting Paris in the future.  Great location, very artistry decoration, super nice host, highly recommend! Nice, clean and well located apartment.Catherine has really been very available and attentive.Thank you for the ease of access you offer to travelers (documents with instructions, keys in an instruction, etc.). Richard was a super nice host. I was there for fashion week and the location was perfect. Very good Value for money. I had a great experience.  Perfect in Paris! We spent a week here for our honeymoon and it was incredible. The apartment is perfectly located on the Pont Neuf bridge and next to the Louvre and is in a very safe area. The apartment is gorgeous and decorated lovely. By far our favorite place we have stayed. HIGHLY RECOMMEND for couples or small families! \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The host was wonderful. He communicated clearly and was extremely welcoming. Thanks, Richard! I reserved Catherine's apartment for guests who wanted to visit Paris.They were all happy with the quality of the apartment. Our experience with Richard was perfect from first contact to checkout. He provided perfect detailed directions, codes for getting in the building, wifi passwords, etc. Richard always responded quickly. Upon arrival, we met Richard in the flat...I don't think I heard a word he said because I was distracted by the powerfully beautiful view out the windows. The Gothic church is seen through three giant windows...so close you can almost touch it. The flat was nicely decorated, exactly as in the pictures. The comfortable bed looked out at the church...which lit up beautifully at night. There was a good sized bathroom with plenty of hot water. The kitchen had everything we need. Comfortable little living room area with a couch, tv and desk. I spent quite a bit of time at the desk enjoying the view! The location couldn't be better...right outside the door is the Louvre...behind the building is the Seine River. Close to metro stops. The area has many restaurants within walking distance. We actually cut short a couple days of sightseeing to hang out in the flat and enjoy being \\\"at home\\\". Thank you so much, Richard! You were the perfect host, so easy and enjoyable to work with! I can't wait to return with my husband! Lisa and son Corey Richard was an amazing host, he immediately made us feel at home in Paris. He was kind enough to recommend a few of his favorite places to eat and provided us with maps and guidebooks when we got there. The flat is just where you want to be in Paris, we were located next to a gothic church that was a pleasure to look at every morning and just a short walk to the Louvre and to rue Rivoli full of shops and restaurants. Musee D'Orsay was also just a short walk from the flat and Notre-Dame was about a 15 min walk or short car ride. Our time in Paris was wonderful and we were glad to have a comfortable flat to go to at the end of every night. Richard was very accessible for any questions during our stay and even let us know about a worker protest happening on the day we were leaving Paris as well as how best to avoid it on the way to the airport. Overall we would highly recommend this flat and Richard as a host. Thank you for a wonderful stay Richard! Me and my friend had really good time in his flat. \\r<br/>Very neat, clean, beautiful house and located next to Louvre, very easy to go anywhere in Paris!!\\r<br/>Richard kindly explained very useful tips to our trip and those were very helpful!  \\r<br/> Good location and good apartment , a bit cold in my opini\\u00f3n. The apartment is the same as what you see in the pictures. Richard is very helpful host. He gave us all the useful information to stay at the apartment and Paris. His apartment is in quiet area and very close to Louvre museum. Night opening of Louvre Museum until 9:30 p.m. on Wednesdays and Fridays, you can easily walk back home during the night (April 2015 info). Richards flat is homey and super conveniently located right next to the Louvre. The view of the gothic cathedral outside never got old, amazing piece of European architecture that was amazing. I had an easy time checking in and checking out, Richard was in contact the entire visit and I didn't want for anything! Richard wrote out some local recommendations and we tried a couple out, great atmosphere, food and cocktails! The subway was very nearby, connecting you to the entire city. We had a great time in a lovely city. Thanks so much Richard!  Great location and Richard was very helpful. Perfect apartment for a weekend in Paris. It was located in center of Paris so i could look around Paris easily. I met Richard the first day he explained his flat in detail so I didn't have any inconvenience. My family of three stayed three nights in Richard's loft. It was exactly as described and pictured; very tidy and very pleasant. Everything worked and we had no problems during our stay. The location could not be better - right next to the Louvre and very convenient to Paris' metro system. The view of the Gothic church across the street is certainly impressive and atmospheric.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Richard himself was an excellent host. He provided accurate directions to the loft, was waiting for us when we arrived and thoroughly explained all the features of the loft. He even volunteered information to help us navigate the subway upon our departure, which was above-and-beyond. Even though English is not his first language, he coped very well with our language and certainly made us feel welcome.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The only downsides to Richard's loft are mentioned in the description: it is a fourth-floor walk-up, so those with excessively heavy luggage or an aversion to stairs should be cautious. Also, the bells of church across the street are quite loud, although they were pretty and did not disrupt our sleep.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>In all, a very positive experience and I would certainly recommend Richard as a host to anyone looking for a place to stay in central Paris at a much more affordable price than most similarly-located hotels. Absolutely incredible apartment in the BEST location. Beautifully decorated and Richard was beyond kind and thoughtful - he gave us a beautiful bottle of wine! This is a great size and layout for an apartment, so beautifully decorated - an absolute gem! Literally across the road from the louvre. Thanks a million!  A nice little apartment, all white, quiet and well located.\\r<br/> Very well equipped. Richard was an amazing host.  His communication was outstanding and his flat is exactly as described.  We were very comfortable and the location and view can't be beat.  Thanks to Richard my family has memories that will last forever from a great stay in Paris.  If he will have us, we will definately return. The flat is absolutely amazing! The location is perfect for exploring Paris. The views from the windows are truly gorgeous! We were extremely comfortable in the flat. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Richard was a great host - he was a clear communicator and open to any questions we had. He gave us a thorough guide of the flat and included detailed instructions for the amenities.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I would recommend his flat to anyone who wants an excellent experience in Paris! Thank you again, Richard! As a first time Airbnb user, I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The location can't be beat - it's so close to the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame are within walking distance. The room itself is also beautifully furnished and quite spacious. Best of all, Richard was a wonderful and attentive host. I can't recommend this listing enough!  The flat is wonderful! You can find anything you need there. The view from the windows is amazing . The location is very good : you can easily walk to all the attractions of Paris . The district is also very quiet s\\u043e you can rest after a long day. Richard is a great Host with gergeouse flat. Communication with him is very easy and friendly. He ready to help you and give information about everything in Paris if he knows and doesn't know (but he can find information for you if you need).\\r<br/>Everything is exellent. Flat is same as pictures + new big mirrow. View from windows is absolutely amazing!\\r<br/>Great location: walking distance to the Louvre, Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame; close to 2 metro station and RER.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Great place, lovely host! Everything was great, I got 100% of what was expected - location, comfort, value. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Thanks you Richard. We had an amazing time at Richards place.  It was very convenient and clean.  Richard even gave us some nice places to eat. We had a great time Ricardo, his wife and their daughter Beatrice are wonderful people. Feel felt safe and comfortable during our stay. Location, flat, wifi, everything was beyond our expectations. I strongly recommend this flat. Nice place. Centrally located. Richard is a great guy and a great host. He is professional and courteous. Great value and excellent location as it is next to the Louvre and a 10 minute walk to Marais, St Germain and the Latin Quarter.  great Parisian choice Richard has been a wonderful host to me and my wife. He has been very helpful to us. The place is spacious and the location is also very good. We are really happy that we choose his place. I'd highly recommend his place to those who are looking for a place to stay in Paris. We could not enjoy Catherine's apartment only one night. We met Catherine during our installation, she provided us with all the information necessary for our installation and our stay. The appearance is well appointed, quiet, the comfortable beds, very well located in relation to the metro. We will try to come back Richard is extremely friendly and did more than everything to accommodate us.  The location of the flat was perfect!  It is between the Louvre Museum and the Notre Dame Cathedral, right in the middle of great shops and cafes. this is a perfect place for a single/couple traveler. with its warm and cozy atmosphere and parisian mood, you can probably enjoy true parisian lifestyle. <br/>i particularly loved the view from the window which shows really old church (a bit creepy at midnight though). it was a perfect desk to read some old books from which i could occasionally glimpse the medieval architecture. <br/>the best part of the flat is its location. it is placed just across Louvre museum which makes it incredibly close to almost every attractions of the city. it\\u2019s only few steps from the metro station (Louvre-Rivoli) though i\\u2019d mostly enjoyed walking.<br/>the host Richard was very kind and helpful. The location of this apartment is amazing!  It was the perfect spot for our family of four. Clean, comfortable and full of character.  We highly recommend! We had an amazing stay at Richard\\u2019s place! The location is awesome and his home was perfect for us. The apartment is very quiet and pleasant, combined with practical equipment such as drying washing machine.The district is quite central and accessible from most stations and metro lines.The building is quiet and located in a busy street.However, we noticed in Catherine that the dishes was not very clean when we arrived and we encountered some technical problems in terms of TV and the phone that unfortunately tainted our stay. My family greatly enjoyed staying at Richard\\u2018s apartment. He was very flexible with the check-in, and even allowed us to come earlier on a moment\\u2019s notice as our plans had changed.  It was great to meet him and get to know him a little bit, and he was thorough in showing us the ins and outs of his apartment. He welcomed us with wine and camenbart and even gave my daughter a copy of Petit Prince!  The view of the gothic church is spectacular and how nice to learn about a  historic  church you might otherwise miss with among the sites of Louvre and Notre Dame. The apartment is in the center of it all and many sites are walkable. We also used the Transit app to  get directions and take buses to restaurants and markets a  bit further a field and to the Eiffel Tower. So easy to get around and nice to mingle with locals and see street life. Our stay at Richards place was fantastic. The location is perfect, just opposite the Louvre and nearby to notre dame. The atmosphere and Persian feel of the accommodation added to a wonderful stay. I can highly recommend Richards abode. Wendy and Perry That view is incredible. We had a great time staying at Richard's flat. The location is unbeatable. The Seine is around the corner, and the Louvre is across the street. It's within walking distance to many top attractions in Paris. The view of the cathedral from the window is amazing. The room is small but cozy, and perfect for two of us. And Richard is a great host and is very easy to communicate with. He is also super kind, and allows us to check out late, as our train is in late afternoon, and we can leave our luggages in the flat while we go visit Louvre. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who wishes to visit Paris. The location of this apartment was great. Walking distance to the Louvre, Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle. <br/>When renting, consider there are 4 floors without a lift. Be sure you will be able to carry your luggage up.  We heard some negative news about Paris before we went there. But when we were really there, we found that the people there were so friendly, polite and co-operative. And the public security was very good.  We didn't meet any problem.  And the owner of the flat, Richard is a very nice person, very thoughtful, helpful and friendly.  I like his welcome flowers and wine. He wrote to me before we arrived, telling me how to reach his flat and pick up keys. And he was very patient answering my various kinds of questions.  And it was a great experience living in his apartment. Everything was so convenient, to Louvre, to metro station, to restaurants and to the super market.  Everything is within 200 metres or 5 minutes. We will for sure to select this flat again when we come to Paris next time.   Great location - perfect host - fast, cooperative, makes life easy.  Wonderful place and perfect location! Richard was a good host and is very willing to make the stay comfortable, recommendation!! We had a wonderful 5 days at Richard's flat. Location is simply outstanding. Unbelievably it's almost on top of the Louvre, but very quiet. One minute walk from Louvre-Rivoli Metro and ten from the RER, so easy if coming from the Eurostar or CDG. So much to see nearby, all walking distance, and fun to just wander. Cafes, shops, restaurants in abundance, coming with recommendations from Richard. The flat is charming, with plenty of space to spread out. Bed extremely comfortable, kitchen basic, but everything you need. Bathroom same. Three very large windows for fresh air and wooden shutters for sleeping. Richard very hospitable and accommodating, he helped me up the stairs with my luggage. Definitely would stay again when in Paris! Great place for those who want close location to many sites, the beds were very comfortable fresh and warm, the kitchen was a little tight but had everything you would need. The stairs were not too bad, but the view was worth it. We felt very comfortable staying at Richards place and would be happy to stay there again. Great location, great recommendations from host on drinking and eating spots. Very comfortable flat! Since I was a child in my early teens I've dreamt of going to France, the large Eiffel Tower poster on my wall that I would sit and get lost in building an image in my mind of what it would look like, smell like, sound like, feel like.  I finally took advantage of a change to go 2 weeks and bring my 11 year old daughter.  Firstly in the south of France followed by 4 nights at Richard's flat in Paris.  In part due to Richard's flat decor, location, cleanliness, his incredible communication despite some hiccups caused on my part, Paris exceeded my expectant dreams!!  I cannot speak highly enough of Richard, and the hospitality of his flat, with it's gorgeous views and proximity to the Louvre and during the presidential election of Macron was an experience we will never forget!!  While the flat was smaller than anticipated, it sufficed in every necessity we could want or need and even has prompted me to downsize upon our return to the States.  What an experience that any trip we take in the future will have to meet least of all attempt to exceed.  Merci boucoup Richard!!  We now love France <3 We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Richard's apartment! It was clean, comfortable & very Parisian. Richard welcomed us with a bottle of wine & lots of information about Paris, maps etc. Location was perfect! Very close to the Louvre, shops, cafes & public transport. It was all very easy, Richard was very responsive to messages via Airbnb app. Highly reccomend staying here. We had a wonderful stay in Paris. Richard met us at the apartment and could not have been more helpful. He is a good host and we had good response when any questions that came up. Location of the apartment made walking to many sights very convenient. Over all a very enjoyable stay. While we did not have the pleasure to meet Richard, he was in communication routinely and responded quickly.  The loft is il a central location and is charming and reflects the Parisian experience including its history that we were looking for!    Richard is an extremely gracious and welcoming host. His place is very clean, secure and in an amazing location. We highly recommend Richard and is place! My family (wife, 8YO and 10YO) stayed at Richard's place for 5 nights.  The size of the flat was just right for our group and far more comfortable than a hotel.  Richard met us upon arrival and we explained everything about the apartment and made recommendations for shopping, restaurants etc.  He is super, interesting man and we enjoyed getting to know him.<br/>The location is awesome.  The church across the street is beautiful and the flat looks right out to the gargoyles which my kids loved.  The Louvre is about 200 meters away as is the Seine.  We were able to walk to many of the beautiful Parisian sights (Notre Dame, Saint Chapelle, Musse D'Orsay, Musee Pompidou, Luxembourg Gardens, Place de la Concorde) and take Uber for about 15 Euro to some places that were a bit too far for the kids to walk (Eiffel Tower and Sacre Coeur).<br/>There are great paths along the river for running which are beautiful and FULL of people hanging out with friends.<br/>Finally, having a washing machine in the flat was great so that we could pack a bit lighter and have clean clothes (we visited other cities as well on the same trip).<br/>Great place, super host.<br/> Richard's place has the best location in Paris, strategic situated just a short 3-5 min walk to the Louvre, the Seine river, about 10-15 min scenic walk to Musee D'Orsay and Musee D'Orangerie. The apartment is also within less than 5-min walk to the Metro and RER, plenty of good restaurants and bakeries around, and main shopping strip. The apartment is clean and very charming in its layout. Check in was very easy. Richard met us on the street and meticulously oriented us to his home. The apartment is located on European 4th floor (American 5th floor) and there is no elevator. It is not a problem for us and we enjoy the daily light exercise but it may be worth knowing ahead of time. Overall, we love Richard's place and will definitely stay here again if we return to Paris. Our stay was satisfactory.Catherine is always while waiting for the comfort of her hosts and ready to help.The apartment is very bright and quiet, clean and with the tools necessary to make a meal or breakfast.The apartment is close to two metro stations and in the neighborhood there are all kinds of stores.Is perfect for two people, three, just a little. \\r<br/> We highly recommend this apartment We enjoyed our home away from home. All smooth. Great location and view. Seine, Louvre all at fingertips.  Dearest Riccardo,<br/>Thank you so much! It was fantastic! <br/>Very wonderful house in a really quiet, which is the center of Paris, the location is amazing, the apartment beautifully furnished with antiques, very nice graphics and paintings on the walls.<br/>Is one of the best apartments for all our travels around the world!<br/>Is truly home away from home!<br/>the view of the Gothic Cathedral is poignant and mysticism, your house is a library of rare beauty ...<br/>Richard friendly welcoming lovely host helped me speaking Italian in an excellent way, thank you very much ... We will come back as soon as possible,<br/>Sure next spring!!!!<br/>I would recommend this magical vacation to all my friends!<br/>Kiss and hugs<br/>your<br/>Cinzia and Alice<br/>\\t<br/>\\tUtile<br/>\",\n          \"Nicolas\\u2019s place was perfect! Amazing location, quiet and peaceful. Apartment had everything we needed for our 10 night trip. Nicolas was very proactive and communicated well. Would highly recommend and will definitely be staying here again next year! Pleasant welcome and framework.Building host and listening to needs and potential visits of visits. Very good stay spent with Nicole.Small corner of tranquility in Parisian bustle.Very accommodating and available host.I recommend Overall this was one of the best Airbnbs I have stayed in.  The location is perfect and despite being in a busy area, it\\u2019s not too noisy (all you hear are the neighbours from time to time). <br/>It\\u2019s a classic old Paris building (you really feel that you are staying in the heart of Paris) and the space is very comfortable. Sounds strange to mention but the toilet works well and the shower has great water pressure, which was a pleasant surprise given the age of the building.  It had all the amenities we needed for cooking, eating, drinking, etc and the coffee maker and coffee was a nice (and appreciated!) touch. It was clean and having the washer (including the laundry soap) was a lifesaver because it was so hot that we needed to do more laundry than expected. <br/>You are minutes away from lots of great restaurants/bars and two metro stations, including Les Halles, which is a major stop for the metro and the RER B.  <br/>We would happily stay here again. Merci beaucoup Nicolas! Jean has been a perfect host. Kind, sweet, precise and with a GREAT place right in the center of Paris. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The location was truly unbeatable: few min walking to Chatelet or Les Halles metro station, lots of cool bistro right around the corner where you coukd get anything to eat, supermarkets to do your food shopping and above all the amazing proximity to lots of beautiful and super famous places in Paris such as Notre Dame & the Saint Chapelle, Le Louvre, the Jardin des Tuileries and so much more!! You could easily walk everywhere. Fantastic. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The apartment, as you can see from the pictures, is clean, MODERN, and has everything you could possibly need: microwave, coffee machine, a little washing machine, flat screen Tv, a super hi fi for music, free wifi for internet connection and a very nice bathroom (that isn't that commonin Paris). Another plus is that the building has a little elevator too!!\\r<br/>\\r<br/>So if you're in Paris you'd be very lucky to stay in such a marvelous apartment. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Thanks Jean!\\r<br/>\\r<br/> My wife and I stayed at Jean's place for 10 nights recently with our one year old daughter. We enjoyed our stay. The place had all the amenities wee needed including a washer, full kitchen, and a bathtub. The location was central to everything including the Les Halles train station. \\r<br/>Jean was professional, courteous, and helpful. The only minor concerns we had was that there was some dust under the tables and curtains which our daughter got into and the sofa bed was a bit noisy. Other than that the place including the kitchen and bathroom was very clean. If we didn't have our daughter with us, we would not have noticed those things. \\r<br/>I would definitely recommend the place to my friends and would stay here again.  Nicole is a super host, welcoming and concerned about our comfort.Friendly and ideally placed loft (5min from the metro).I highly recommend this address. This is an absolutely wonderful place to stay in the Paris. The reservation process was easy and fast. The place was clean and quiet, it's close to the Pompidou and all fantastic places in Marais.  The bed was super comfortable. We rested well. Good location for Paris discoveries. We would definitely stay there again & recommend it to anyone. If you're looking to explore Paris, this is a great home base. The location is hard to beat. Close to trains, museums, markets, etc. My wife and I stayed here for 10 days and ended up only needing to take the Metro 3 or 4 times our entire stay.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The apartment itself is accurate to the pictures posted. Clean and modern. We tend to cook most of our meals, so the kitchen came in handy. It's well stocked. And, the bathroom is quite large.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I highly recommend staying here. Just be aware, you'll have a small amount of \\\"chores\\\" to do. Nothing crazy. Just watering his plants, and keeping the counter-tops spotless. If you're up for that, then you'll enjoy your stay here. Mini stay in a professional setting, I really appreciated the friendly welcome from Nicole very attentive.The loft is very nice with its mini garden full of vegetation.I highly recommend! The studio is very charming, cozy and clean, with all appliances necessary for a nice stay in Paris !\\r<br/>Jean made a nice work in decorating and furnishing the studio, so it is easy to feel like home.\\r<br/>The location is perfect: very central, close to museums, metro / RER stations, bars and restaurants. I had a pleasure to stay in Jean\\u2019s apartment for couple of months due to my work assignment.  The apartment itself is located perfectly, in the heart of Paris. It is very well equipped and nicely designed. Jean was also a great host, always making sure that I feel comfortable in the apartment, even when he was outside of Paris. In short, it is a perfect play to stay in Paris, independently of length of your stay! Amazing host as well as amazing location. Very charming studio. We had a great stay. Nicolas was quick on communication. The apartment is close to many great spots and attractions. Steps away from the Pompidou art museum. The apartment was very clean and quiet. My husband and I would probably stay there again if we travel to Paris again. Great location. Very comfortable and clean apartment. Absolutely loved our stay. Close to many great restaurants, sites and metro train stations. Apartment was clean, cute and cosy. Would recommended to anyone coming to Paris!
